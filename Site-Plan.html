        <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>I would like to create an informational site that would act as an
                online family cookbook.  This site will have all of our families
                favorite recipes complete with instructions, pictures, 
                techniques, and video tutorials.  I would like to do this 
                because my family is spread across the United States and because
                my wife loves cooking.  My site would also help spread the 
                delicious traditions of our family culture with others 
                throughout the world.  This site would help bring my spread out 
                family together by sharing our favorite recipes with each other.
                Now that I am thinking about creating this not only for my 
                family but for the world as a product I would like to tweak it a
                little.  I would like my site to be a platform for families 
                around the world to create their own family cookbooks.</p>

			<p>Michael Smith is a loving husband and a father of three children.  He works for 
			a local insurance company making around $50,000.00 annually as an insurance agent.  He and his family are a typical middle-class
			family living on a budget and making ends meet.  He lives in the state of Arizona.  Though he works as an insurance agent, the 
			most important title he carries is Dad.  He occasionally cooks a meal for his family when his wife is unable or he wants to.  
			When he is going to cook a meal it is important to him to have a clear list of ingredients and instructions for him to 
			successfully feed his family.  He likes going to famrecipe.org because he can easily access his family’s cookbook or favorite 
			recipes and have access to his wife’s instructions and notes to make the meal just the way she likes.  On a day when he will be 
			visiting the site he might say something like:  “My wife isn’t feeling good so I would love to help out by cooking a good meal 
			for my family so she can rest.  I wonder what my wife’s favorite recipes are and what her meal plans where for this day?” 
			Michael goes to famrecipe.org because he knows he will be able to find all of the information he needs to pull off having a 
			successful meal.</p>

			<p>Stacy Smith is a stay-at-home mother is five children who loves cooking delicious, healthy meals for her family.  
			Though she doesn’t bring home an income, she knows the value of her job as a loving mother who knows how to make a budget 
			work without compromising on the health of her family.  This is why she has a profile with and visits famrecipe.org daily 
			so she can create, organize, and plan her meals with ease.  Feeding her family a healthy diet on a budget isn’t easy in America 
			where she lives where everything is fast, convenient, highly processed food.  She hates processed foods.  She visits the site 
			daily in order to plan her meals for the week, generate a grocery shopping list, and to share her favorite recipes with her 
			extended family who she is connected with on the website.  She also loves the fact that she gets to share her recipes with the 
			rest of the world.  On a typical day you might hear her say:  “We have a busy evening today so I need to make a meal that has 
			very little prep and cook time.  I wonder which one of my recipes has the lowest amount of prep and cook time combined?”</p>

			<p>Heather Smith is a proud mother and grandmother who believes in the power of a family sitting around a table together to 
			enjoy a healthy, home cooked meal together.  She spent her life as a mother fine-tuning her cooking skills and her recipes 
			loves that she can pass that on to her children and grandchildren through famrecipe.org.  She and her husband are enjoying 
			retired life but she still cooks like she has to feed an entire family of hungry mouths.  She visits the site often though 
			she is not too comfortable with technology because of how easy it is to create and share a recipe with her family members whom 
			she is connected with on the site.  On a typical day you might hear her tell a friend:  “I hate trying to search the internet 
			for a recipe I like, that is why I love famrecipe.org because I have access to all of the recipes I love through my family’s 
			cookbook.  It’s so easy to use!"</p>
