						<h2>Cake</h2>
							<p>Prepared Yellow cake mix or homemade yellow cake recipe, completely cooled,</p>
						<h2>Ingredients</h2>
						<h3>Milk Syrup:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>1 can (15 ounces) cream of coconut</li>
							<li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
							<li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
							<li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Garnishes:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>2 medium-size ripe bananas</li>
							<li>Sweetened cream (see instructions below)</li>
							<li>1 cup sweetened flaked coconut, toasted</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Directions</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>In a blender, combine the cream of coconut, evaporated milk, cream, and vanilla and process until smooth.</li>
							<li>Pierce the cake all over the top with the tines of a fork or a thin wooden skewer.  The more pokes, the more 
							the syrup will soak into the cake. Using a large spoon or ladle, spoon some of the milk syrup over the cake. Let 
							the syrup soak into the cake, then continue spooning the syrup on top until all of it has been used up. Cover the 
							cake loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or until all of the syrup is absorbed. </li>
							<li>For the sweetened cream, pour 1 cup heavy whipping cream into a large (preferably chilled) glass bowl and beat 
							it on high speed until thickened 1 ½ minutes. Stop the machine and add ¼ cup confectioners’ sugar and ½ teaspoon 
							pure vanilla extract. Beat on high speed until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Makes 2 cups.</li>
							<li>Spread coconut on a rimmed baking sheet and bake it at 350 degrees until golden brown, 7 minutes, or toast it 
							in a skillet over medium-low heat on the stovetop.</li>
							<li>Remove from heat. Add sour cream until combine.</li>
							<li>Cut the bananas, if cutting crosswise into 1/4-inch slices. Slice the cake and serve it with sliced bananas, 
							sweetened cream, and toasted coconut, if desired.</li>
