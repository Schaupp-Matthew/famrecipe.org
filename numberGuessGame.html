Remove this bit from the other function and place it in this function.

and then return true when the guess is correct otherwise false.

The numberGuessGame function will continue to call the isRight function until it is true. It will add one to a variable each time the user is wrong.

Then will tell the user when they got it right and how many guesses in a message

Input: A guess from the user.
Processing: Check to see if guess is correct.
Output:  If correct return true, otherwise return false. Loop until true or game over.*/
