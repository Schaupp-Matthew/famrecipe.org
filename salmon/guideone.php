					<p>Hi everyone! I am excited to be your guide for your journey down the Salmon River! 
					I love this river, and I know its every bend, rock, eddie, and rapid. I can tailor your 
					journey to fit your comfort level and guarantee you will have a blast on the raft. I have 
					experience traversing a wide range of rapids on most of the rivers in the western states. Join me 
					this summer for a ride you will never forget! Go ahead and <a href="adventure.php">book your adventure now!</a></p>
