					<p>Hi everyone! Surfs, or rather rapids, up! Whitewater paddle boarding is like riding a never ending wave that 
					you didn't have to catch! If you love surfing you will love this. I was originaly a professional surfer when 
					I discovered stand up paddle boarding. I fell in love with it on my first experience. I am passionate about it and 
					love my job which is why I know you will love it too. Join me 
					this summer for a ride on your own never ending wave! Go ahead and <a href="adventure.php">book your adventure now!</a></p>
