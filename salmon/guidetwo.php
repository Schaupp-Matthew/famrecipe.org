					<p>Hi everyone! I am excited to be your guide and to wet some lines on the Salmon River! 
					I have loved fishing since I was a young girl. My father taught me how to fish when I was 8 years old. 
					As my knowledge and skill level increased I began to enter competitions when I was in high school and 
					I soon began winning! Like the old saying: Practice makes perfect! The Salmon River is full of a variety 
					of beautiful fish that are fun to catch. I love river fishing because the fish always put up a good fight 
					because they are stronger from swimming against the current. Join me 
					this summer to catch more than just a fish story! Go ahead and <a href="adventure.php">book your adventure now!</a></p>
